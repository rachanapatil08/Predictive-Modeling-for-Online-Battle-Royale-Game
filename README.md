# Predictive-Modeling-for-Online-Battle-Royale-Game

The anonymized dataset consists of about 4.4 million records and 28 predictors that includes player data and in-game statistics such as headshots, kills, swim distance, etc.

Since the game is all about survival, the objective of this project is to analyze the data and build a model to devise the best strategy for winning the game, for example, whether the player needs to hide in one place and attain victory or does the player needs to come out and win by killing the opponents.

This project involves 3 machine learning models - Multiple Linear Regression, Regression Trees, K Nearest Neighbors. Based on the RMSE value, the best model is chosen.
